# Installation
``` 
composer require tanthammar/livewire-auto-routes
``` 

# Routes in `web.php` takes precedence!
You can use web.php as normal. Routes declared in your Livewire components are registered after the routes in web.php. 

# Routes are registered in alphabetical order!
Livewire component **FILES** are looped in alphabetical order in the `app namespace`. One way to control the load order is to group your components in subfolders with suitable names like `routeGroupA`, `routeGroupB`, where routes in "routeGroup**A**" would be registered before "routeGroup**B**".

# Usage
* You generate routes via traits or by adding a `route()` method to your Livewire component.
* Your Livewire components can exist in any folder inside the `app` namespace.
* If you don't add any of the traits or the `route()` method, the Livewire component is treated just as a normal component, thus ignored by this package.



### Guest route Trait
* Applies the `guest` middleware.
*  **The property is used to generate both the route name and url.**
* Used for "plainly" named routes like 'users'

```php 
use Tanthammar\LivewireAutoRoutes\HasGuestRoute;

class FooComponent extends \Livewire\Component
{
    use HasGuestRoute;
    
    protected string $guestRoute = 'foo';
}
```

### Auth route Trait
* Applies the `auth` middleware.
* **The property is used to generate both the route name and url.** 
* Used for "plainly" named routes like 'users'

```php 
use Tanthammar\LivewireAutoRoutes\HasAuthRoute;

class FooComponent extends \Livewire\Component
{
    use HasAuthRoute;
    
    protected string $authRoute = 'foo';
}
```

### Custom route
* `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route` and add a `route()` method to your component. 
* Use this method when you need  `/` slashes or `{optional?}` parameters.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

class FooComponent extends \Livewire\Component
{
    public function route(): \Illuminate\Routing\Route|array
    {
        return Route::get('foo', static::class)
            ->middleware('auth') //default middleware is 'web'
            ->name('foo');
    }
}
```
